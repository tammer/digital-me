The future might in fact be very, very bright for software developers ☀️ 

Here's the logic, tell me where I'm wrong:

The 20x Productivity Leap: AI hasn't just made devs slightly faster; it’s made them 5x to 20x more productive.

The Buy/Build Reversal: For decades, "Buy" won because "Build" was too expensive, too slow, and too risky. But if building is suddenly 20x cheaper, the scales tip.

The Death of "Shrink-Wrapped" SaaS: Why pay a massive annual subscription for a generic solution that gets you 80% of what you need, when an "Omni-Dev" can perpetually build and maintain 100% of what you need?

Think about the math of the labor shift:

In the old world, a SaaS company might employ 10 developers to maintain a product for 1,000 customers.

In the new world, those 1,000 customers realize they don't need the SaaS company anymore. They decide to build their own bespoke, internal versions.
To do that, they each hire an "Omni-Dev".

The result? Those 10 developers at the SaaS company lose their jobs, but the market suddenly has a demand for 1,000 Omni-Devs at the individual organizations.

As long as it takes more than 0.01 of a developer’s time to maintain a bespoke system, the total demand for developers actually increases.

Perhaps the future isn't "No Code", it's "No SaaS"!

Last month we made eight new investments. Seven of those were in companies doing what I call “Niche AI.” That is to say, they are using AI to solve a specific problem endemic to a particular industry.

In each case, three things were true:

1️⃣ The product was essentially “Software-as-a-Knowledge Worker.”

2️⃣ The problem was unsolvable by computer science until the advent of AI.

3️⃣ The pre and post AI work is substantial, meaning plain ChatGPT will never be a competitor.

I have an infinite appetite for these kinds of opportunities. If you’ve got a niche AI idea, I’ve got $250,000 for you to spark your idea to life this month.
